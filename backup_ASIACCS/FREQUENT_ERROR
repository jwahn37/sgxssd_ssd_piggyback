openssd jasmine has someting sad error which is really hard to find.
I will write that kinds of error here.

1. uart_printf() error

if there is so many uart_printf(), it can geneartes infinite booting error
//if the number of string in uart_printf() is larger than 57, It generates infinite booting error.
//ex) uart_printf("111111111122222222223333333333444444444455555555556666666"); //makes error

2. mem_copy() error

Sometime, the mem_copy load from oldest value of source address .
Maybe it is a DMA problem.. like old cache in dma engine??
Don't trust mem_copy. 

DRAM to DRAM일때는 Destination이 DRAM_ECC_UNIT의 배수여야만함.
